		<h4>Cricket</h4>
		<p>Cricket, now phrased as the unendorsed national sport of India owes its introduction to the British.

            The game includes 2 teams with 11 players on each side. The two teams usually have a toss to decide which team gets to bat or bowl first.
            
            Cricket is mostly an outdoor game. While it's ideal to have a proper pitch with the required equipment, cricket can be played any place with a horizontal stretch of land. Gully cricket for example is very popular in India, a common sight on a lot of Indian streets.
			
        </p>
      
        <p>Oh yes, Cricket is for everyone especially if you enjoy team sports but you're also looking to develop individually and understand the importance of self-reliance. When the time comes to bowl or bat or even take a catch, your teammates can't to it for and that's where the individual performance will matter.‍

		<h4>Hocky</h4>
		<p>Hockey is a game that is played around the world by many countries. Some of the top hockey playing nations includes India, Pakistan, New Zealand, Netherlands and Great Britain. The pinnacle of the sport comes in the form of the Olympics where it has been one of the top attended sports since its reinstating in 1928.
		</p>
		<p>A goal is scored when a player hits the ball in between the goal posts and over the line from within the 16 yard area. The ball must be struck with the players stick and any use of the body will be called as an infringement.

			Goals can be scored from penalty corners which are awarded when a foul is committed in the 16 yard area. From a penalty corner the defending team all line up on their goal line. The attacking team must all be outside the 16 yard area when one player hits the ball to them from 10 yards either side of the goal line. As the ball is played back a team mate stops the ball before another strikes at goal.</p>
