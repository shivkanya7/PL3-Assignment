00:00:13.564 --> 00:00:17.863
You gotta go and get angry
at all of my honesty

00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:22.660
You know I try but I don′t do
too well with apologies

00:00:22.854 --> 00:00:26.853
I hope I don′t run out of time.
Could someone call a referee?

00:00:27.049 --> 00:00:32.648
′Cause I just need one more
shot at forgiveness

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:37.065
I know you know that I made those
mistakes maybe once or twice

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:41.858
And by once or twice I mean maybe
a couple of hundred times

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.049
So let me‚ oh‚ let me redeem‚ oh‚
redeem‚ oh‚ myself tonight

00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:51.560
′Cause I just need one more
shot‚ second chances

00:00:51.756 --> 00:00:52.755
Yeah

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:55.958
Is it too late now to say sorry?

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.749
′Cause I am missing more than
just your body‚ oh

00:01:01.963 --> 00:01:05.262
Is it too late now to say sorry?

00:01:05.458 --> 00:01:08.557

I will take every single piece of
the blame if you want me to

00:01:39.754 --> 00:01:44.253
But you know that there is no innocent
one in this game for two

00:01:44.449 --> 00:01:48.948
I will go‚ I will go and then you go‚
you go out and spill the truth

00:01:49.158 --> 00:01:53.857
Can we both say the words‚
say‚ forget this?

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:55.068
Yeah

00:01:55.056 --> 00:01:58.255
